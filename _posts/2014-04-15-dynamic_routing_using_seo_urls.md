I've authored an article on the bonetics blog a while back about [Dynamic routing using SEO urls](http://bonetics.com/blog/hello-is-it-me-you-re-looking-for/). It goes over a gem I've developed to accomplish SEO requirements of an app we've been developing. Check it out and let me know what you think.
