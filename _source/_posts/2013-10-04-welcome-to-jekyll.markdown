Good news everyone!

I've gotten around to finally build a site for my company and a blog for
myself. After a lot of back-and-forth I decided to go with [gitghub pages][gh-pages].
I will be capturing my progress right here (kinda meta isn't it?) so
stay tuned for updates. Also I will post anything I find interesting on
the internets so stay tuned for that also...
